# CS model

The CS model Toolbox is a Matlab toolbox for the numerical resolution of the nonlinear current sheet model (ie. the formal resolution of Maxwell’s equations in annular subdomains delimited by cylindrical current sheets) in the magnetostatic approximation. It is well suited to model slotless wound rotor electrical machines, for example.

If you use this code, send me message with the reference and I will add it to the users list. If you would like to acknowledge it (and direct others to it), you could use a reference like this:
